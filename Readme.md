Frontend : React 
Backend : Django
Database : MySQL
API: Django REST Framework (DRF)

Your React application runs in the user's browser, providing the interactive user experience.

When a user performs an action (like making a post or liking something), the React app sends a request to your Django REST Framework API.

The Django backend receives this request, processes the logic (e.g., "save this new post"), and interacts with the MySQL database to store or retrieve data.

Django then sends a response back to your React app, which updates the UI to show the new post or the updated like count without needing to reload the entire page.
